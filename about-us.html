    <p>
        Established in 1981, Little Angels' School (LAS) began with a vision to transform the educational landscape of Nepal. 
        What started as a small community initiative has now grown into one of the country’s most prestigious institutions, 
        sprawling across 350 ropanis of lush, green landscape in Hattiban. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Our motto, <strong>"Wisdom is Divine,"</strong> serves as the foundation of our teaching methodology. We don't just 
        focus on rote learning; we encourage our students to question, innovate, and lead. Over the past four decades, 
        we have nurtured thousands of graduates who are now making significant impacts in medicine, engineering, 
        arts, and entrepreneurship globally.
    </p>
